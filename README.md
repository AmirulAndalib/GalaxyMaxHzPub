# Galaxy Max Hz

Some features of Galaxy Max Hz need **WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS** permission in order to work. For additional details, you can check the app's [official xda-developers thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/app-galaxy-max-hz-refresh-rate-control-quick-resolution-switcher-screen-off-mods-adaptive-mod-keep-high-adaptive-on-power-saving-mode-and-more.4181447/).

----------------------
### TLDR

 * Run `adb shell pm grant com.tribalfs.gmh android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS`

----------------------

Alternative methods:

For **rooted** devices without using a PC:
(1) Install a terminal emulator app from play store (e.g. [Termux](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux)), grant root permission and run the following command: `su -c pm grant com.tribalfs.gmh android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS`.
or (2) Install this [mini-app](https://github.com/tribalfs/gmhWriteSecureSettings/releases), grant root permission and run.

For **non-rooted** devices without using a PC:
(1) Install LADB from play store. Follow LADB setup instructions. Once LADB setup is done, execute `pm grant com.tribalfs.gmh android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS`

 * Run `export PATH=.:$PATH`

 **Without this, you will get `adb: command not found` errors.**

### 6. Locate ADB

 * From the terminal window, type "cd ". **Notice the empty whitespace after the "cd".**

 * Locate the extracted `platform-tools` folder from Windows Explorer or Finder(macOS) and drag it over to the terminal window. It'll auto-fill the path.
