# Galaxy Max Hz Premium Features

* Keep High/Adaptive motion smoothness when power saving mode is enabled whether manually or by the system/adaptive power saving (Note: Starting OneUI 4.0 samsung already blocked this on some device)***

 * Adaptive refresh rate mod for devices supporting multiple refresh rates but do not have the stock Adaptive motion smoothness (e.g. S20 series, S20FE, TabS7/S7+) with the ability to set the brightness threshold for its activation***

 * Quick-doze mod: Quickly enter doze mode during screen-off that can not be interrupted by motion ***

 * Set minimum refresh rate for adaptive mode to 60hz or lower (if supported)***

 * Resolution switcher filter: Filter what screen resolutions to include for the resolution switcher QS tile.

 * Auto SENSORS OFF (experimental non-root workaround):
   Device sensors will automatically turn off while screen is off until the device is unlocked. This helps minimize battery-draining motion-triggered wakelocks while device is not being used.

 * Statusbar net speed indicator
